# Deploying backend server

We are recommending all people to self-hosted the API as much as possible and doing this might help me and others with no downtime.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Git installed on your machine
- A text editor of your choice

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amvstrm/api.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

3. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

You have successfully started the API server. Now you are ready to deploy it to any provider and use it for your app.
