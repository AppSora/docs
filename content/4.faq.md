## Video is not loading on the player

If you see the loading animation for too long on the player, 
it's most likely because the video is not fully loaded, video does not exist or the video url has expired.

You can fix it by refreshing the watch page.

## API returned Too many request but the header isn't

Since we use the official Anilist's GraphQL API, we can only get 90 req per min as stated 
on their [API docs](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/rate-limiting).

## Can i use your logo and name?

No, go read our [License](/license)

## CORS error when watching the video

::alert{type="danger"}
__Only stream URL is allowed, any url that unrelated to stream URL will not be allowed.__
::

We provided 2 free proxy url:
- https://cors-stream.amvstr.ml/
- https://cors-stream-2.amvstr.ml/

Add this before the stream URL:

```url
https://cors-stream.amvstr.ml/<STREAM URL>
```
