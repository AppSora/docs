# Video player

amvstrm provided 5 different players in case one of them is not working.

## Player

**To switch to a different player**:

- Integrated Player (MAIN) ::br amvstrm uses Artplayer to power our site player and also as a primary one. This player provided a lot of features that we have added using Artplayer API.
- Plyr.io: :br If the main player died for no reason, plyr is your second choice. Plyr is the player that is used by Animixplay (RIP) also has been originally used on the old amvstrm and we realize that a lot of people use our stream API route just to get the player URL.
- Nspl::br NSPL is also the 3rd option if all of them died for no reason. nspl is powered by player.js which provides a really simple API to use.
- Embedded (Gogoanime & StreamSB and other)::br Gogoanime uses the embed to stream their anime and this player is full of Ads and it is really annoying but in case all of the 3 players die for no reason, maybe enable Adblocker before using them.

## Integrated Player

We use Artplayer as the primary integrated player because we want to customize the player and provide more features such as :

- Skip Opening and Ending with Skip Button and Auto Skip function
- Automatically save playtime
- Easily switch your stream source and quality
- Autoplay the next episode without selecting the episode list
- Theater mode

## Video data

In case the stream data fails to load or gives you the wrong data, you can refresh the data from the API and fix the issue.
