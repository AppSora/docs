amvstrm provided 5 different players in case one of them is not working.

__To switch to a different player__:  

![swplyr](/docs_assets/switchplayer.gif)

- Integrated Player (MAIN)  
  amvstrm uses Artplayer to powered our site player and also as a primary one. This player provided a lot of feature that we have added using Artplayer API.

- Plyr.io  
  If the main player died for no reason, plyr is your second choice. Plyr is the player that is used by Animixplay (RIP) also have been originally use on the old amvstrm and we relise that a lot of people use our stream API route just to get the player URL.

- Nspl 
  nspl is also the 3rd option if all of them died for no reason. nspl is powered by player.js which provided a really simple API to use.

- Embedded (Gogoanime & StreamSB and other)  
  Gogoanime uses the embed to stream their anime and this player is full of Ads and it is really annoying but in case all of the 3 players die for no reason, maybe enable Adblocker before using them.

## Integrated Player

We use Artplayer for integrated player because we want to customize the player and provided more feature such as :

- Skip Opening and Ending with Skip Button and Auto Skip function
- Automatically save play time
- Easily switch your stream source and quailty
- Autoplay next episode without selecting episodes list
