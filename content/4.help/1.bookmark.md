## Bookmarker's FAQ

- **What data that will be exported out?**  
  Your data include play times, bookmarked anime and latest watch history will be exported out into one JSON file.

- **Where does the data store at?**   
  Your data will be store locally in your browser using localStorage. 

- **Why not using cloud option?**  
  I want to make amvstrm as local as possible and easier to self-hosted without the need of annoying enviroment configuration. Even though cloud saving give us so much advantages, it is still annoying to setup and expensive once it grows.

  Feel free to contribute or fork our repository if you want to rework or add authentication and more stuff to it.

- **Why i got an error when importing my data?**  
  ::alert{}
  The answer might be changed in the future!

  We validate the file using ID from file name and ID inside the data. 
  
  ```javascript
  // from file pages/bookmarks.vue
  const validateImportedData = (importedData, expectedBmkid) => {
    try {
      const data = JSON.parse(importedData);
      if (data.bmkid !== expectedBmkid) {
        throw new Error(
          `BMKID mismatch: expected ${expectedBmkid}, got ${data.bmkid}`
        );
      }
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return null;
    }
  };
  ```
  Since you understand the code, you can fix it easily by changing the file name or fix the id inside the file.
