Never modify the file name and data inside the JSON file because it contained important information that will validate the file.

### Cloud integration

::alert{type=warning}
The feature is still in beta! 
::

We are now adding the way to sync or backup your data to [Deta Base](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/reference/deta-base). 

- Create your deta account here

**_Deta is currently close the account creation, please wait til 10th October. If you want to use the feature, comment it on our [Announcement](https://github.com/orgs/amvstrm/discussions/27) page. _**

::button-link{icon="mdi-account" href="https://deta.space" color="pink"}
Create your Deta account
::

- After you create your account, Go to your collections and create a new collection.

- Then generate your new key from your collection

::alert{type=danger}
We store your key in the localStorage and please do not share your collection key with other people because people can read and write the data to the collection.
::

- Go back to the bookmarker page and add the key to the input

Now you can use your collection key to any devices.  

- More information:  
  - We store your data in Deta Base by providing a Deta collection key and now you can save everything to your own Deta Base.
  If you don't want to save it to the cloud, you can still save it locally and export it. However, We still store your data in local storage to reduce the amount of requests sent to our API.  

  - We don't want to see user data and managing it would be complicated and worst of all expensive asf so we decided to use this method to store your data in your cloud instance with Deta Collection Base.  

  - We specifically choose Deta because of how easy it is to implement our code and It is free for everyone, unlike other clouds where you have to pay for what you use.

## Bookmarker's FAQ

- **What data that will be exported out?**  
  Your data include play times, bookmarked anime and latest watch history will be exported out into one JSON file.

- **Where does the data store at?**   
  Your data will be store locally in your browser using localStorage. 

- **Why not using cloud option?**  
  I want to make amvstrm as local as possible and easier to self-hosted without the need of annoying enviroment configuration. Even though cloud saving give us so much advantages, it is still annoying to setup and expensive once it grows.

  Feel free to contribute or fork our repository if you want to rework or add authentication and more stuff to it.

- **Why i got an error when importing my data?**  
  ::alert{}
  The answer might be changed in the future!
  ::
  We validate the file using ID from file name and ID inside the data. 
  
  ```javascript
  // from file pages/bookmarks.vue
  const validateImportedData = (importedData, expectedBmkid) => {
    try {
      const data = JSON.parse(importedData);
      if (data.bmkid !== expectedBmkid) {
        throw new Error(
          `BMKID mismatch: expected ${expectedBmkid}, got ${data.bmkid}`
        );
      }
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return null;
    }
  };
  ```
  Since you understand the code, you can fix it easily by changing the file name or fix the id inside the file.
