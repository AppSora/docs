## Video is not loading on the player

If you see the loading animation for too long on the player, 
it's most likely because the video is not fully loaded, video does not exist or the video url has expired.

You can fix it by refreshing the watch page.

## API returned Too many request but the header isn't

Since we use the official Anilist's GraphQL API, we can only get 90 req per min as stated 
on their [API docs](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/rate-limiting).
