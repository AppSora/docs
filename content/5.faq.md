## Video is not loading on the player

If you see the loading animation for too long on the player, 
it's most likely because the video is not fully loaded, video does not exist or the video url has expired.

You can fix it by refreshing the watch page or switch to different player.

## API returned (Too much req) but the header isn't

Since we use the official Anilist's GraphQL API, we can only get 90 req per min as stated 
on their [API docs](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/rate-limiting).

## Can i use your logo and name?

No, go read our [License](/license)

## CORS error

You should install the CORS extension on Chrome web store or Firefox addon in order to play an video.

## More scraper & streaming source when?

Working on it using [Anify's](https://anify.tv) API.

## What if your website got DMCA?

Still completely operate it normally but available only in my country.

## Will you rework your API from JS to TS?

Maybe not.. I still suck at it

```
