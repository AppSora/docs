# API Usage

### Overview

Since we provided data from Anilist and Gogoanime, you are allow to use our API for commercial or non-commercial purposes.

### Spamming and Misuse

We strictly prohibit any spamming or misuse of the API. This includes but is not limited to:

- Sending more than 300 requests per minute.
- Sending requests with malicious intent.
- Using the API to scrape or harvest data.

If we detect any spamming or misuse of the API, we reserve the right to block access to the API without notice.

### Rate Limit

All of our endpoints are `300 requests per minute`. Rate limiting is great for us because we have weak server that hosted using SaSS.

The API will send the following headers in the response to each request:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed per minute.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining for the current minute.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the rate limit will reset, in Unix timestamp format.

Example response headers:

```header
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 297
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1624291200
```

### Error messages

If a user exceeds the rate limit or misuses the API, the API will return an error message with the appropriate status code and message. The message will indicate that the user has exceeded the rate limit or misused the API and must stop doing so.

To avoid reaching the limit, you should cache the requests or using a backoff strategy when receiving an error response or self-host your own [amvstrm's API](/guide/backend).

### Commercial

For commercial reason, we recommend you to self-host the [API](/guide/backend) for better performance and use redis to cache the data.
