# Deta space

## App

We will be listed our app on deta.space discovery soon...

## Manual deploy

### Prerequisites

- A Deta.space account
- Deta Space CLI installed on your local machine

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork our repo by clicking on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the Git CLI.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/amvstrm.git
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (Optional)

1. Navigate to the cloned repository directory using the terminal.
2. Install the dependencies using npm.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Config the nuxt.config.ts

Since deta.space is limited, we need to disable ssr in order to deploy it to the web.

```
ssr: false
```

If you want to use ssr, you can comment it out or remove routeRules from the config completely.

```
routeRules: {
  "/": { static: true },
  "/pwa": { static: true },
  "/search": { static: true, swr: false },
  "/anime/**": { swr: true },
  "/watch/**": { swr: true },
  "/pwa/search": { static: true, swr: false },
  "/pwa/anime/**": { static: true },
  "/pwa/watch/**": { static: true },
  "/about": { static: true },
  "/privacy": { static: true },
},
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Space

1. Install the Space CLI.

3. Deploy the application to Vercel using the following command.
