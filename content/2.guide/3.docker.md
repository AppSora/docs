This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to deploying v1 amvstrm's frontend and backend with docker image.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the images, you must have the following:

- Docker installed on your system
- A Docker Hub account to access the images
- The `docker-compose` tool installed

### Deployment Steps

1. Pull the Docker images from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull vekaverjj/amvstrmapiv1
docker pull vekaverjj/amvstrmv1
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  amvstrmapiv1:
    image: vekaverjj/amvstrmapiv1
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - amvstrm_network

  amvstrmv1:
    image: vekaverjj/amvstrmv1
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - amvstrm_network

networks:
  amvstrm_network:
```

This file defines two services, `amvstrmapiv1` and `amvstrmv1`, and a network called `amvstrm_network`. The `amvstrmapiv1` service runs the backend API on port 8080 and the `amvstrmv1` service runs the frontend on port 3000.

3. Start the containers using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command starts the containers in detached mode (`-d`) and maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the `amvstrmapiv1` container and port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the `amvstrmv1` container.

4. Access the frontend

You can now access the frontend by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

You have successfully deployed amvstrm's backend and frontend Docker images with Docker. You can now access the frontend by visiting `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API by visiting `http://localhost:8080` or sending requests to `http://localhost:8080/api`.
