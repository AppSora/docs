  - If you recieve 30$ credits, the compute must be `Basic 1GB Mem / 25 GB Storage / 1vCPUs` and Instances must be 1. You can upgrade by adding more money to your account later if you want more compute power.
  - For Custom runtime check below...
  ::

  __*You must enable custom runtime template and paste the code below to the textbox because if you don't, it will crash!__

  ```
  # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
  FROM node:18-slim as base
  ENV NODE_ENV=production

  WORKDIR /src

  # Build
  FROM base as build

  COPY --link package.json .
  RUN npm install --production=false

  COPY --link . .

  RUN npm run build
  RUN npm prune

  # Run
  FROM base

  ENV PORT=80

  COPY --from=build /src/.output /src/.output

  CMD [ "node", ".output/server/index.mjs" ]
  ```

  **And make sure your port is 80 on the config same as the `ENV PORT 80` on the dockerfile**

- After that click deploy and wait for the app to finish building it... (It can take a while)

Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application by visiting the URL provided by Klutch.  

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed our application to the web...
