# Configuration

## Enviroment varible

### Frontend

amvstrm required API_URL and VERSION in order to work. If you plan to deploy your own one, you can use our amvstrm's API or deploy your own backend and use it.

```env
API_URL=
VERSION=

DISCUS_ID=
POSTHOG_PK=
POSTHOG_HOST=
```

::alert{type="warning"}
api.amvstr.ml domain is down for no reason, please use `https://api-amvstrm.nyt92.eu.org` instead.  
::

#### Why Posthog?

Posthog is an self-hostable and open source analytic that offer a lot of features like session replay, product analytics, A/B testing, etc. Posthog also offer free tier which are better for hobby project and more.

You can use Google analytic by modifying our code and env but we recommend Posthog for this.

### Backend

It is optional but you can configure it to bypass rate limiting or allow cors to your website domain. This is helpful if you want to save your server resource and protecting other people from using the API.

```env
RATE_LIMIT=300
BLOCK_WITH_CORS=false
ALLOWLIST=https://example.com
PORT=8080
SENTRY_DSN_URL=
```
