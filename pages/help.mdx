## Bookmark

![](../public/bksample.png)

Bookmarking is a great way to save your favorite anime and
our website have its own bookmarking tool to bookmarked your anime locally.

You can manage the bookmarking data from amvstr.ml/bookmarks and start using it.

**How to use bookmark**

1. Go to any anime pages
2. Click bookmark button
3. Go to Bookmark page from the sidebar
4. Done

If you want to remove one anime from your bookmarks,
you can do it from the bookmark page or on anime page by clicking on the unbookmark button.

**Limitation**

- Bookmarking data is stored in your browser. Once you clear the browser data, you will lose your bookmarking data.
  We recommend you try to export your bookmarking data before clearing the browser data.

- Store only 100 bookmarks. If your browser have some issue with storing data, it will be possibly deleted by the browser itself.

- If your bookmarking data is corrupted or modified, you will not be able to access your bookmarking data.

**Why not use cloud way?**

Cloud storage is a great way to store your data but
it required us to spend a lot of money to set up (authentication service, storage, etc).

We are planing to use cloud storage in the future but we are not sure yet.

**Modifying your bookmarking data and Understanding each data**

If you want to modify your bookmarking data, you can use our tool [Here](https://editbookmark.amvstr.ml).

```code
{
  "amv_val_str":"AMVSTRM_BOOKMARK_DATA_DO_NOT_TOUCH",
  "info":"WARNING MESSAGE",
  "time": UNIX TIME,
  "bookmarks":[
    ALL YOUR DATA
  ]
}
```

Each export bookmarks data will be in json format. 
You will be see those data once you export.

- amv_val_str is the most important string that will check if your data does contain amvstrm bookmark data.
if the string didnt present in your data, it will be considered as corrupted data or modified.

- info is a warning message that will be displayed to you warning not to modify your data.

- time is the time when you export your data.

- bookmarks is the data that you save in your browser.

If you modify have the duplicate data, it will append to the existing data.
