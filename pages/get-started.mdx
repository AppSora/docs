# Get Started

## Deploy to vercel

You can start by cloning our project and deploying to Vercel by clicking the link:

[![](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?project-name=amvstrm&repository-name=amvstrm&s=https://github.com/amvstrm/amvstrm&env=API_URL&envDescription=Do%20not%20put%20any%20other%20api%20url%20only%20https://api.amvstr.ml)

*It is important to note that the API URL is the only one that is required or else you will get a 404 error or Data Not Available.*

Vercel will create the amvstrm repository when you create the project and Deploy it automatically when you click the button.
