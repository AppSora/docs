# Donations

Even though I'm not a huge fan of donations, I'm always looking for ways to help support my work and make money from it.
I deploy the frontend for free with pages but not the backend. We host backend on railway and we have to pay for it.

- If you want to help support my work, you can donate via:
  - [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/amvstrm) (USD)
  - Paypal : [admin(at)amvstr.ml](mailto:admin@amvstr.ml) (USD)
  - [Coinbase](https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/dc5b4ea2-257e-4224-a2f5-234f019d43d0) _*bitcoin only_
  
- Local Donations
  - ABA : [SOON]
