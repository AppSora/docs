# Projects

We provided a REST API for our users to use for their projects. The more I scan the code and logs, the more I realized that the API is huge and it's working really well especially the stream routes.

This is a list of projects that used our API.

We were ranked by everythingmoe in the top 30 anime site lists also most of the traffic is actually from the everythingmoe website. Not only that but we are in the list of the top scraper website on Kuroiru and that is wild for us.
